### Playlist Contributions

All playlists are stored in the [/data/genre-info/ directory](https://github.com/patrickgalbraith/mapofmetal/tree/data/data/genre-info).

Each genre is stored as a seperate `json` file with the following structure:

```js
{
  // Genre Title
  "title": "Heavy Metal",

  // Genre Description - May contain HTML
  "description": "Heavy metal (often referred to simply as metal)...",

  // List of tracks
  "tracklist": [
    {
      "artist": "Black Sabbath", // Track artist name
      "title": "Black Sabbath",  // Track name
      "year": "1970",            // Year released

      "videos": [                // List of YouTube video IDs
        "0lVdMbUx1_k",           // The ID can be found in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[THIS BIT]
        "2KnyL4IFcwo",           // If a video fails to play the next video in the list is tried
        "qrVKmTPFYZ8"
      ]
    },
    // ...and so on
  ],

  // Genre ID
  "id": "heavymetal"
}
```

### Genre Suggestions

I am happy to receive suggestions for new genres however due to the amount of work involved I would expect at least the following to be provided.

 * Name of genre
 * Short description of genre or link to a description of the genre
 * Decade that genre began - 80s, 90s, 00s, etc...
 * List of tracks exemplifying the genre (at least 4, ideally 8-10)

Please be aware that adding a new genre to the map can take time as it requires making changes to the underlying map design.
